# Boston Dynamics API - C++

The C++ SDK includes C++ libraries and examples.

## Coding standards and dependencies.

The C++ implementation follows these requirements:

- A modern C++14 compiler toolchain.
- Does not make use of exceptions or RTTI.
- Generally complies with the Google C++ style guide.
- Doxygen-friendly comments, particularly in header files.

Library Dependencies:

- C++14 standard library. Many advanced features, such as functional programming and concurrency support are used.
- Google's gRPC C++ library, as well as it's transitive dependencies.
- Unit tests depend on gTest.
- Eigen for math operations
